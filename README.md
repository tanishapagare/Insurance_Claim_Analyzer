# Insurance_Claim_Analyzer
A data analysis project focused on understanding patterns in health insurance claims using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Explored key factors such as gender, age group, region, diabetic status, blood pressure, number of children, and smoking habits to identify which groups are more likely to file higher claims.
